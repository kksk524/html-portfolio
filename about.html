<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an experienced product owner that is currently working on increasing my technical skills by taking full stack development classes.  I just finished the HTML course and loved it! I am looking forward to learning more.</p>

<p>When I am not working, I spend my time with family and friends.  I enjoy walks with my dog, working out, travelling and watching football.</p>

<p>My favorite quotes are "The miracle isn't that I finished, the miracle is that I had the courage to start" by John Bingham.  This applied when I was running a half marathon and can be actually be applied with other life changes.</p>
